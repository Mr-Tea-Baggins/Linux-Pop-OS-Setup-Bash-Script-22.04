- **(Review / Alter the [pop_config.sh](https://github.com/Mr-Tea-Baggins/Linux-Pop-OS-Setup-Bash-Script-22.04/blob/main/pop_config.sh) file as required)**
- then load Terminal window
- run: 'chmod +x pop_config.sh'
- run script with ./pop_config.sh
- The script will run taking you through setting up your machine, loading apps etc

**All feedback greatfully received**, thanks
