# Linux Pop OS (22.04) Setup Bash Script

A fairly comprehensive setup script for getting the most usable Linux Pop OS desktop system setup using 22.04.  The aim being to reduce the amount of time to freshly install and configure Pop OS.

**This script will:**

- Make changes to improve upon default install
- Add bluetooth speaker reconnect script for auto pairing after reboot and system wake up
- Install a great choice of apps
- Give insdtructions on how to setup your system further 

**Use:**

- Install Linux [Pop OS 22.04](https://pop.system76.com/) on your PC (choose Download button)
- Download all the files in this repository, and move them to your Documents folder

- **(Review / Alter the [pop_config.sh](https://github.com/Mr-Tea-Baggins/Linux-Pop-OS-Setup-Bash-Script-22.04/blob/main/pop_config.sh) file as required)**
- Add your bluetooth speaker MAC Address to **recon_bt.sh** and **pre-suspend.sh** files
- then load Terminal window
- run: 'chmod +x pop_config.sh'
- run script with ./pop_config.sh
- The script will run taking you through setting up your machine, loading apps etc

**All feedback greatfully received**, thanks
